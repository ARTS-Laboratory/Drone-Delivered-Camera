The raspian OS on the Raspberry Pi is a 32-bit, which does not accept any full tensorflow object detection, so instead Tensorflow lite was used.

The current training model is being used to detect faces, and is being trained on google-colab on my desktop computer since it can speed up the training with the 
graphics card

Currently I am training the model with ~45 images (much under desired amount), and validated with 10 images.  I am testing to see how much data is necessary to get
reasonable facial detection.  With the 45 images, it had an average precision score of ~27%.  I am looking to see how much data is needed to get it to 50+% AP.

The colab file used to train the model is https://colab.research.google.com/github/khanhlvg/tflite_raspberry_pi/blob/main/object_detection/Train_custom_model_tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=OUqEpcYwAg8L

Added 10 more images for a total of ~55, AP increased to 40%

Experimenting with different repititions of going through the data to see how it effects average precision
